# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Marcus [he/him]

I'm a multi-disciplinary creative living in the DM[V] with my partner Kae and our kitkat [Hana](https://www.marcusrelacion.com/hana/).

By day, I'm a product designer that codes and combines these disciplines to build accessible and inclusive design systems, websites, and software.

When off the clock, I enjoy spending my time [documenting everyday life, live events and sports](https://www.marcusrelacion.com//photos/), [spending entirely too much time (trying) to keep my team alive](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ana/), looking for new recipes to cook, and going on hikes.

If you're interested, you can view what I'm currently [focused on](https://www.marcusrelacion.com//now/).

Thank you for stopping by! ✨

I'm a multi-disciplinary creative based in the DMV with my partner and [precious long bean](https://www.marcusrelacion.com).

Currently, I'm a Senior Product Designer focused on building accessible and inclusive design systems, websites, and software. When I'm not building, I'm a [photographer](https://photos.marcusrelacion.com) who enjoys capturing moments while commuting, at live events, and in nature.

Feel free to check out what Iâ€™m currently [getting into](https://www.marcusrelacion.com/now).

Thanks for stopping by!

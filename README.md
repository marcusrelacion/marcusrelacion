# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm Marcus [he/him]

I'm a multi-disciplinary creative living in the DM[V] with my partner Kae and our kitkat [Hana](https://www.marcusrelacion.com/hana/).

By day, I'm a product designer and developer, who combines these disciplines to create accessible and inclusive design systems, software, and websites.

When off the clock, I enjoy spending my time [documenting life](https://www.marcusrelacion.com//photos/), [supporting my tanks](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ana/), cooking new recipes, and going on hikes.

Here's what I'm currently [focused on](https://www.marcusrelacion.com//now/).

Thank you for stopping by! ✨
